# Overview

This repository contains an R function for calculating the slope and aspect from a Digital Elevation Model (DEM). The function `calculate_slope_aspect` takes a raster object representing the DEM as input and returns two raters representing slope and aspect.

# Function used
The function that was used to create slope and aspect using this package is called calculate_slope_aspect. The input data that is used or integrated with this function is a digital elation model of the study area of interest. The slope and aspect derived from using this function is in degrees.

# Usage 
Load the raster package
```{r}
library(CarbR)
data("Elevation")
```
